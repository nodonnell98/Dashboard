# Dashboard
This is a test dashboard for practicing new web technologies.

Technologies:

This Dashboard has been created with HTML, SCSS, TypeScript, NodeJS and Webpack.

This is my first look at using a bundler like Webpack and so was a new learning expereience. It has also been a chance for me to 
try out creating a more responsive website with the use of flexbox.

To find the dependencies please look at the package.json file.
